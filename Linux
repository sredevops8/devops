1. What is the command to list the contents of a direcory, line by line and ordered by size ascending in human readable format?

ls -laShr <absolute path of the directory>
Ex: ls -laShr /etc/

2. How would you add a DNS server to a network interface in Linux?

Create an interface with name ifcfg-<interfacename> under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

ex: 
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

IP address: 192.168.0.100
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Hostname: client1.example.com
Domain name: example.com
Gateway: 192.168.0.1
DNS Server 1: 8.8.8.8
DNS Server 2: 4.4.4.4

Save and exit
Then restart network service to affect the changes from the config file
systemctl restart network

Then run dig <hostname> to check the dns server ip details

ex: dig client1.example.com

3.If the DNS server you've just added is not reachable, how can you get any particular hostname to resolve locally?

We need to setup a loocal DNS by adding the ip of the host to /etc/hosts file
Ex: vi /etc/hosts
Domain example.com
192.168.0.1 client1.example.com
save and exit

Then try to ping the host - ping client1.example.com



4.How would you check for SELinux related errors?

Check if selinux is enabled or not - getenforce
Check /var/log/audit/audit.log file for more information about selinux deniel messages
query Audit logs - ausearch -m AVC,USER_AVC,SELINUX_ERR,USER_SELINUX_ERR -ts recent
If there are no matches, check if the Audit daemon is running
In case auditd is running, but there are no matches in the output of ausearch, check messages provided by the systemd Journal: journalctl -t setroubleshoot
If SELinux is active and the Audit daemon is not running on the system, then search for certain SELinux messages in the output of the dmesg command: dmesg | grep -i -e type=1300 -e type=1400
If SELinux is still blocking switch to permissive mode - setenforce 0 (command line)
To change SELinux status permanently change SELINUX=permissive in  /etc/selinux/config file



5. Write the commands to add 30GB disk space to a logical volume named "docker" that belongs to a logical group named "docker-group".

lvextend -L +30G /dev/mapper/vg_docker-group-docker
resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg_docker-group-docker
If there is no sufficient diskspace on volume group then we need to extend the volume group first with help of a physical volume, then we can extend lvm
Check the size now - df -h command

6. In the root of this repository, create a Bash script called "listit.sh", when executed, this script must do the following (in order):
Create a file called directories.list that contains the directory names only of the current directory.
#########################################################################################
Add a line at the beginning of the directories.list file that reads "line one's line".  -- Didn't understand this question
##########################################################################################
Output the first three lines of directories.list on the console.
Accept an integer parameter when executed and repeat the previous question's output x amount of times based on the parameter provided at execution.

Created file "listit.sh"
